    "\n",
    "The star actually moves in two dimensions, $x$ and $y$ (or right ascension $\\alpha$ and declination $\\delta$).  Gaia measures its position in just one dimension, at an angle $\\theta$ away from the $y$ or $\\delta$ axis (east of north).  So, the position that Gaia measures is \n",

It makes more sense to measure time from a reference epoch during Gaia's observations (like taking $t=0$ at 2016.0) rather than taking $t=0$ at the year zero, extrapolating the model more than 2000 years into the past.  It actually makes it more challenging to solve numerically!  So, where I write $t$ above, I really mean the date as measured from the reference epoch of 2016.0.  This is already computed for you as the variable `t` (in units of Julian years).\n",
